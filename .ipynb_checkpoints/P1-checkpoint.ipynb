    "In this project we apply methods like region masking, canny detection and Hough transform to detect lanes in an image as well as video. A camera is mounted on top of the car. It is used to capture images. Then this image is processed to detect lane line on the road. The lane lines can have different widths and colour. Some of them maybe bright and some may be dull in colour. So self-driving car should check all this conditions and accordingly travel on the correct path.\n",
